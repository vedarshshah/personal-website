								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>
									In the summer of 2022, I was a Technology Development Program intern at Optum,
									a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. I was part of the behavioral health division and
									was in a group of 5 interns.
								</p>
								<p>
									The internship was in a “Shark Tank” format. We were required to identify a
									healthcare need, design a technology solution, create a minimum viable product
									(MVP), formulate a business plan, and pitch to senior leadership for their 
									buy-in.
								</p>
								<p>
									We learned that the national average wait time for behavioral health services is 48
									days, owing to a significant shortage of behavioral health professionals and high
									demand for their services. We saw an opportunity to continuously engage clients
									during the extensive wait times and improve treatment outcomes.
								</p>
								<p>
									We decided to leverage journaling as a tool to engage and improve clients'
									behavioral health during wait times. Our approach was to use a 3-tiered journaling
									system summarized using AI, visualized in a network diagram, and analyzed to extract
									insights for providers. We developed a minimum viable product web application, which
									was well-received by Optum management.
								</p>
								<p>
									I was responsible for team management, project management, product design, sprint
									planning, sprint execution, and status reporting to Optum stakeholders. I led the
									team in pitching our product to Optum senior leadership. Besides leading the team
									for our collective outcome, I defined the application framework, designed the user
									experience and psyche map, developed backend API endpoints, and integrated frontend
									and backend.
								</p>
								<p>
									I chose to pursue this internship to experience an entrepreneurial environment and
									get the opportunity to brainstorm, design, and develop a product that addresses a
									real-life need. It enabled me to experience the challenges associated with
									innovation while also improve my hard and soft skills. It also enabled me to connect
									with and learn from experts in various areas including user experience, artificial
									intelligence, system design, and business pitching.
								</p>

								<h3>Reflection</h3>
								<p>
									When my team and I were designing the product, we wondered how we could leverage
									clients' journal entries to enhance treatment outcomes. I came up with the idea to
									show behavioral health providers a dashboard for each client, which would display
									statistics and trends derived from the client's journal entries. Especially
									insightful would be trends regarding the emotions the client is experiencing
									frequently within each situation and how the client's emotions have changed since
									the last appointment. The dashboard would also display AI-generated summaries of all
									journal entries since the last appointment. The dashboard enables providers to
									quickly understand the client's emotions and journal entries before an appointment,
									allowing them to spend more appointment time on treatment.
								</p>
								<p>
									During the internship we had two competing goals. One was to develop a complete and
									coherent MVP. The other was to ensure each team member got to work on all parts of
									the application for everyone's individual growth. Due to the tight timeline of the
									project, I divided the tasks in a way that leveraged everyone's individual strengths
									and we successfully completed our MVP. However, this meant that most of my teammates
									only got to work on one or two parts of the application through the internship. As
									project manager, I had failed in achieving a key team goal. I learned that when I am
									leading a team with competing goals, it was important to strike a balance and
									communicate with the team early on to find a win-win solution.
								</p>
								<p>
									I had many key learnings from this experience. I wanted to explore the process of
									ideation - getting to know the domain rapidly, collaborating on generating ideas,
									brainstorming, and zeroing in on one real-life complex problem to solve. I
									experienced a successful ideation process as my team and I generated ideas which
									were deeply rooted in Optum's domain and were promising solutions to complex
									real-life needs.
								</p>
								<p>
									I wanted to hone my skills in selecting a final idea from the ideation process. I
									consider we scored a winner as the idea my team and I ended up selecting promised to
									solve a pressing need, aligned with Optum's business priorities, and was
									demonstrated through a MVP during the internship.
								</p>
								<p>
									I wanted to experience and practice leading, managing, and working effectively
									within a team. I consider myself successful as I led and steered the team to deliver
									the MVP and business plan, met all stated objectives, delivered on our committed
									timeline, and earned the approval of Optum leadership.
								</p>
