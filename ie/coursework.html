								<h3>CS 216: Everything Data</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I selected CS 216: Everything Data as my gateway elective because of its focus on
                                    acquiring, analyzing, and visualizing data—skills that are essential for innovation
                                    in technology-driven ventures. This course provided me with hands-on experience
                                    working with diverse data types, enabling me to derive actionable insights and make
                                    data-driven decisions. My key takeaway was learning how to think creatively,
                                    exploring data from different perspectives to uncover patterns and trends, and using
                                    computational tools to solve real-world problems.
                                </p>
                                <h3>I&E 352: Strategies for Innovation and Entreprenurship</h3>
                                <p>
                                    One of the most valuable lessons I learned in I&E 352 is the importance of focusing
                                    on solving problems rather than fixating on solutions. I learned to approach
                                    innovation through the lens of addressing customer needs and refining solutions
                                    based on feedback. Practical experiences like the food truck challenge demonstrated
                                    that while market research provides initial direction, real-world testing and
                                    customer feedback are critical for validating and improving ideas. I also learned
                                    the importance of building effective, committed teams and fostering a positive,
                                    adaptable culture, as exemplified by case studies of ventures like Upswing and
                                    Envirofit. These insights have reshaped how I think about entrepreneurship and will
                                    guide me in building ventures that solve meaningful problems, prioritize team
                                    dynamics, and create positive, lasting impacts.
                                </p>
                                <h3>LIT 320S: Social Movements and Social Media</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I selected LIT 320S: Social Movements and Social Media as my elective course
                                    because it examines the intersection of technology, media, and social change,
                                    aligning with my goal of leveraging technology to create meaningful impact. This
                                    course broadened my perspective by exploring how various technologies, from social
                                    media to radios and film, have been used historically as tools for social movements
                                    and transformation. A key takeaway was understanding the dual nature of technology—
                                    it can empower social movements by amplifying voices and mobilizing action, but it
                                    also requires ethical considerations to prevent misuse.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Connections</h3>
                                <p>
                                    These courses provided a cohesive foundation for understanding how to leverage
                                    technology to drive impactful change. CS 216 honed my technical skills by teaching
                                    me to creatively analyze and visualize data, uncovering insights essential for
                                    innovative, data-driven solutions. I&E 352 complemented this by shifting my focus
                                    toward solving customer problems, emphasizing the importance of testing solutions
                                    with real-world feedback and fostering effective teams and adaptable cultures. LIT
                                    320S added a broader societal perspective, demonstrating how technologies,
                                    including social media, can drive social movements while highlighting the ethical
                                    responsibilities that come with innovation. Together, these courses reinforced my
                                    certificate goals by equipping me with technical expertise, entrepreneurial
                                    strategies, and a nuanced understanding of technology's role in addressing societal
                                    challenges.
