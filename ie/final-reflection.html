								<p>
									The I&E Capstone course fundamentally shifted how I think about building a venture.
									Coming into the class, I believed that in the early days of a startup, the most
									important — and perhaps only — priority was building the product. But through case
									studies, class discussions, guest speakers, and our final project, I realized that
									product development is just one piece of a much larger puzzle.
								</p>

								<p>
									The Capstone taught me that to create a successful venture, you have to think
									holistically. This includes identifying a real market opportunity, conducting TAM
									analysis, understanding unit economics, and building a business model that scales.
									It also means being deliberate about team structure — making thoughtful decisions
									about roles, responsibilities, and equity splits that reflect the unique value each
									founder brings. And even though early financial projections are rarely accurate, the
									discipline of creating them is essential — both for internal planning and for
									signaling to investors that you've done the strategic thinking required to build
									something that lasts.
								</p>
								<p>
									As part of the final project, I took on the perspective of a CEO — thinking through
									what it would mean to lead with clarity, define our vision, and coordinate efforts
									across design, engineering, and marketing. It gave me the opportunity to step into a
									leadership mindset and consider the broader strategic elements of building a
									venture, including product-market fit, user acquisition, and long-term
									differentiation.
								</p>
								<p>
									My understanding of both myself and the broader world of innovation has evolved
									significantly through this experience. I now see entrepreneurship not just as
									invention, but as iteration — a process that blends creativity, empathy, and
									disciplined execution. I've learned that I enjoy leading with vision, collaborating
									across disciplines, and building products that empower people — and that I'm
									comfortable working in the ambiguity and chaos that early ventures often bring.
								</p>
								<p>
									The I&E Certificate has been a powerful complement to my majors in Computer Science
									and Statistics. My technical coursework taught me how to build; the I&E program
									taught me how to translate those skills into meaningful solutions that people
									actually want. Together, they've shaped how I think about career opportunities at
									the intersection of technology and business.
								</p>
								<p>
									As I graduate from Duke, I feel more equipped than ever to build something new —
									whether that's launching a venture of my own or driving innovation from within an
									existing company. I'm deeply grateful for the perspective, tools, and confidence the
									I&E program has given me, and I'm excited to carry those lessons forward into
									whatever comes next.
