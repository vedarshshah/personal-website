								<h3>Description</h3>
                                <p>
                                    During the summer of 2023, I was a LEAP intern at Fidelity Investments, within the
									Voice Innovation team. My primary focus was the development of SlySearch, a
									pioneering project aimed at leveraging voice commands to redefine the way users
									interact with financial services. This innovative tool was designed to simplify the
									stock screening process, making it more accessible and intuitive for a wider
									audience, including those new to investing or not digitally inclined.
                                </p>
								<p>
									My responsibilities were deeply technical yet creatively challenging. I developed
									the backend, building a responsive and efficient API that could seamlessly process
									voice commands and interact with complex financial data. The project demanded a
									sophisticated integration of artificial intelligence, particularly in understanding
									and executing user queries with high accuracy.
								</p>
								<p>
									My decision to pursue this project was driven by my keen interest in the
									intersection of technology and design. The opportunity to contribute to a project
									that leveraged cutting-edge technologies like voice recognition and AI to enhance
									user experience was perfectly aligned with my career aspirations and academic
									pursuits. This experience allowed me to apply and expand my technical knowledge,
									while also gaining invaluable insight into the importance of user-centered design in
									creating impactful and innovative solutions.
								</p>
								<p>
									Overall, my internship at Fidelity Investments enriched my understanding of
									technology's potential to revolutionize industries and improve lives. It solidified
									my commitment to pursuing a career where I can continue to blend technology and
									design to solve real-world problems.
								</p>

								<h3>Reflection</h3>
								<p>
									Throughout my internship at Fidelity Investments on the SlySearch project, I was
									tasked with navigating and resolving complex problems, pushing me towards
									innovation. One significant challenge was enhancing the tool's ability to understand
									and process diverse and complex voice commands accurately. To address this, I
									proposed integrating a more advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithm
									that could better grasp user intent and context. This idea stemmed from my
									coursework and personal interest in AI, demonstrating the potential of sophisticated
									AI to streamline user interaction with financial platforms.
								</p>
								<p>
									A memorable moment of failure occurred when an initial prototype of SlySearch
									struggled to accurately interpret certain financial terms, leading to incorrect data
									being presented to users. This failure taught me the importance of rigorous testing
									and the value of iterative design. By embracing this setback, I learned to
									incorporate user feedback more effectively into the development process, leading to
									significant improvements in the tool's accuracy and usability.
								</p>
								<p>
									The most crucial lessons from this experience revolved around the power of
									user-centric design and the importance of resilience in the face of challenges. I
									learned that truly innovative solutions come from understanding the end-user's needs
									and continually refining the product based on real-world usage and feedback. This
									approach not only enhances the product's effectiveness but also ensures it remains
									relevant and accessible to its intended audience. Additionally, experiencing and
									overcoming failure reinforced my perseverance and highlighted the importance of a
									flexible, adaptive mindset in the technology sector. These insights are invaluable
									as they shape my approach to future projects and challenges, underscoring the
									interplay between technology, design, and user experience as fundamental to
									innovation.
								</p>

								<h3>Artifact</h3>
								<p>
									Fidelity considers all of our deliverables as intellectual property of Fidelity and
									does not allow us to share outside of Fidelity recipients. Hence, I have created the
									following slide deck that describes my experience, contributions, learnings, and
									challenges.
